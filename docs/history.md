# Session History

**History** is a top-level page that lists every agent session this machine holds on disk,
whether or not Mission Control ever launched or saw it. Open it from the title bar, with
<kbd>h</kbd>, or at `#/history`. The design and its later stages are in
[the session history plan](plans/session-history/plan.md).

Claude Code is the only agent with a history reader today. Codex and Pi declare none, so their
sessions do not appear yet.

## The list

- **Order.** All time, newest activity first, grouped by day, 50 rows a page with **Load
  more** for older ones.
- **Conversations only.** The list shows interactive, SDK and unclassified sessions. One-shot
  and reviewer runs, which are most of what Mission Control's own background work leaves
  behind, are cataloged but not listed.
- **Title.** The session's custom title, else its AI title, else its first prompt.
- **Row.** Repository (or the raw cwd when no repository was resolved, with the full cwd on
  hover), branch, kind, model, cost and duration.
- **Transcript gone.** When Claude Code's retention (`cleanupPeriodDays`, 30 days by default)
  deletes a transcript, its row stays and carries a **Transcript gone** badge. Rows are never
  deleted.
- **First run.** The catalog fills in the background after the daemon starts. While it does,
  the page reads "Indexing N of M sessions" and the rows appear newest first as they are
  indexed. While that line is showing, the page re-reads the catalog a second after each answer
  lands, so a slow read is never cut off by the next one.

## A session

Select a row's title, or open `#/history/claude/<id>`, to read one session. **← History**
returns to the list as it was, with the rows already paged to. A deep link naming an agent
this build does not know, or an id that is not a UUID, lands on the list; a well-formed id
History has not indexed says so.

- **Header.** Title, kind, repository, branch, working directory, model, start and last
  activity, duration and cost, each shown when the transcript recorded it.
- **Conversation.** The session's messages, rendered by the same component the live
  conversation panel uses (`ConversationMessages` in `TranscriptPanel.tsx`), read from the
  transcript on disk from the top. **Load more messages** reads the next window. It is
  read-only: there is no composer.
- **Transcript gone.** The header stays, with the **Transcript gone** badge, and the
  conversation says it was removed by Claude Code's retention.
- **Live.** A session the Registry is running carries a **Live** badge in the list and in its
  detail, and the detail offers **Open in Fleet**, which selects its card. The detail reads the
  transcript when it opens; it does not stream. Live status is read when the row is served.

## Session kinds

A Claude session's kind comes from its transcript, by these rules in order; the first match
wins:

1. `interactive` when its `entrypoint` is `cli`.
2. `unclassified` when no `prompt_snapshot` recorded a tool list. A missing snapshot is never
   read as an empty tool set.
3. `one_shot` when the snapshot lists no tools, or only `StructuredOutput`.
4. `reviewer` when it lists at least one of `Read`, `Glob` or `Grep`, and nothing outside
   `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` and `StructuredOutput`.
5. `sdk` when the snapshot's `cliPrefix` is Claude Code's own preset.
6. `unclassified` otherwise.

The rules live in the Claude reader (`src/server/harness/claude/history.ts`), not in shared
code. Kinds are persisted (`HISTORY_KINDS` in `src/shared/history.ts`) and append-only.

## How the catalog is kept

- **Reader.** Each harness declares a nullable `history` slot (`HistorySpec` in
  `src/server/harness/types.ts`): the roots to walk, how to enumerate transcripts, an
  incremental summarize, and the stable rule that chooses between two files carrying one
  session id. Claude's walks `~/.claude/projects` (a custom `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is not
  followed), lists only top-level `<sessionId>.jsonl` files, and counts subagent runs under
  `<sessionId>/subagents/` without listing them. It reads `cwd` from records, never from the
  project folder name, and skips record and attachment types it does not know.
- **Store.** `history_sessions` in `harness.db`, one row per agent and session id, created in
  `migrate()` and written only by `HistoryStore`. See
  [database and migrations](database-and-migrations.md).
- **Reconciler.** `HistoryReconciler` starts after the daemon is serving and rescans every
  30 seconds. An unchanged transcript costs one `lstat`; a changed one is re-summarized from
  the byte where its last parse stopped, and a shrunk file or a new inode starts over. A file
  that holds nothing a row can be built from is remembered with its fingerprint and not read
  again until it changes. Several files carrying one session id are compared only when one of
  them appeared, went or changed. New and
  changed files are indexed newest first in batches of 25, each written in one short
  transaction followed by a yield to the event loop. A row is marked gone only after a pass
  walked every root of its harness without seeing the file. A root, project folder or file
  that exists but could not be read (permissions, I/O) makes the walk incomplete, and an
  incomplete walk decides nothing; only one that is not there at all counts as empty.
- **Repository.** Resolved when a row is indexed and stored: a worktree pool slot maps to its
  pool's main checkout even after the slot is gone, a `worktrees/<taskId>` checkout to its
  task's repository, and any other existing path through Git.

## API

Every route is loopback-only like the rest of `/api/*`, takes no path, and is not exposed as an
MCP tool. A session is addressed as `:agent/:id`, where `:id` must be a UUID; its transcript
path always comes from the catalog.

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/history/sessions?cursor&limit` | `{sessions, nextCursor, progress}`: one page of conversations, newest activity first, and the backfill's `{indexing, indexed, total}`. A malformed cursor or an out-of-range limit is refused with 400. |
| `GET /api/history/sessions/:agent/:id` | `{session}`: the catalog row. 404 for an agent with no reader, a non-UUID id, or an id the catalog does not know. |
| `GET /api/history/sessions/:agent/:id/messages?cursor` | `{messages, nextCursor}`: a window of turns read forward from the byte offset `cursor` (the top when absent), through the same path-based window reads a live session uses. A window is at least 100 turns and 512 KB. 410 when the transcript is gone; 404 as above, or when the cataloged path does not resolve, through symlinks, under one of its harness's roots. A malformed cursor is refused with 400. |

Every row carries `liveSessionId`: the Registry session running that conversation now, joined
when the row is served and never stored.

## Settings

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MISSION_HISTORY_RECONCILE_MS` | `30000` | Rescan cadence; `0` turns the recurring scan off. |
| `MISSION_HISTORY_BATCH_SIZE` | `25` | Transcripts summarized per batch. |
| `MISSION_HISTORY_BATCH_PAUSE_MS` | `0` | Extra pause after each batch, for tests that watch a backfill. |
