// Every headless `claude -p` mints a session id and writes a real transcript, exactly as an
// interactive session does. Nothing ever reads them and nothing ever deletes them: 153 of 250
// transcripts sampled on this machine were already Foreman's, before the goal refiner started
// adding one per card per refresh.
//
// Claude derives a transcript's directory from the spawning process's cwd, and every headless
// run spawns in `HEADLESS_CWD` (`headless-cwd.ts`), so they all land in ONE directory - which
// this prunes by age. The sweep does not distinguish whose a `.jsonl` is, so how far it can
// reach depends on whose that directory is, and that differs by platform.
//
// On Linux it is exclusively ours by construction. The cwd is `<state dir>/headless`, owner-only
// and created by Mission Control, so no human session runs there and this sweep never touches
// `~/.claude/projects/-tmp/`. It used to: the cwd was the shared `/tmp`, and the sweep deleted
// the transcripts of sessions the human started from `/tmp` along with ours. The transcripts left
// in `-tmp` from before the move stay there: this sweep cannot tell ours from the human's, so
// it leaves them all, and they can be removed by hand.
//
// On macOS it is the per-user `$TMPDIR`, and not exclusively ours: a human who runs `claude`
// interactively from `$TMPDIR` gets a transcript in the same encoded project dir. What bounds
// the risk there is circumstance, not construction - `$TMPDIR` is normally unset for an
// interactive shell, so a real session's cwd is a repo; the sweep only ever touches
// `*.jsonl`; and the 24h mtime floor means even that human's transcript survives until a day
// after they last touched it. Deliberately accepted, not overlooked.
//
// The same holds for any cwd that merely ENCODES like the headless one. Claude's encoding is
// lossy (`claudeProjectDir`: every non-alphanumeric becomes `-`), so `/a/b_c`, `/a/b-c` and
// `/a/b c` all share `-a-b-c`, and Claude itself keeps their transcripts in one directory. A
// session run from such a cwd is swept on exactly the terms above, and nothing here can tell
// its transcripts apart from ours.
//
// Rejected: pointing CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR at a throwaway dir, which would isolate these
// perfectly. It relocates auth along with everything else, so the runs could silently fail to
// authenticate - trading a disk-space problem for an "intent never reconciles and nobody
// knows why" problem.

 * cannot drift apart. `cwd` is a parameter only so tests can name either platform's value.
 *
 * The `realpathSync` is load-bearing and was found the hard way. Claude resolves the cwd
 * through symlinks BEFORE encoding it, and on macOS `os.tmpdir()` is `/var/folders/…/T`,
 * which is really `/private/var/folders/…/T`. Without this the derived name is
 * `-var-folders-…-T` while the transcripts pile up in `-private-var-folders-…-T` - so the
 * sweep finds no such directory, removes nothing, reports nothing, and looks like it works.
 * Verified against a real `claude -p`, which wrote to the `-private-` form.
 *
 * Falls back to the unresolved path if realpath fails (the directory is gone, or on Linux not
 * created yet because no run has needed it), which can only make the sweep a no-op - never
 * point it somewhere else.
